            Hi, my name is Omar.<br/>
            I'm majoring in Computer Science at FAU and I am in my senior year.<br/>
            I am a full stack developer who predominantly codes in Javascript, Golang, and C++<br/>
            I enjoy listening to music, being around my cats or friends, and  <br/>
            cooking food. One of my career goals is to one day own a start-up and make a lot of money.<br/>
            I am a developer on this team.
