            Hi, my name is Dustin, I'm a college computer science student with a passion for developing web and mobile applications.<br>
            I enjoy exploring new coding languages, finding clever solutions to complex problems, and pushing the boundaries of software<br>
            development. In my free time, I enjoy taking part in hackathons, playing the piano, and spending time with friend and family<br>
            I often finds inspiration from the creative minds I comes across in the tech world, and am constantly looking for ways to make <br>
            a difference in the world of software development. I take pride in my work - this is reflected in the quality of apps I've made
