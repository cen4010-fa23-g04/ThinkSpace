        Hello my name is Carlo Leiva and Iâ€™m fascinated in understanding what<br/>
        is needed to be a great full stack developer, work with others and or<br/>
        manage a company as well so I hope this class helps with that since it<br/>
        covers both sides of the coin (making a project and collaborating with others).<br/>
         I love strategy games and play chess competitively. I know python , Java , html ,c,c++, and sql.<br/>
         I am a dog person and big family person . I have taken IOS mobile last semester with an amazing professor,<br/>
          which helped me how to collaborate with team members on github.<br/>
           I'm excited for this class because I know it will be useful for our software career.
