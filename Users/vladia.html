            Hi there! My name is Vladia Zouga. I am a currently a junior Computer Science Major<br>
             at Florida Atlantic University.  I plan to become a Salesforce Platform developer<br>
             after I graduate. I have the most knowledge when it comes to front end development with HTML, <br>
             CSS, and JavaScript. In my free time I enjoy dancing, videography, and spending with <br> 
             my family and friends.
