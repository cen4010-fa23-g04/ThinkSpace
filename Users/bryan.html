            <p>
            I am working as one of the developers in this project. 
            My goal is to become a Database Administrator.
            I enjoy working with Python and MySQL, and am currently taking the time to learn Java.
            A lot of my spare time is used to work on either projects with a small group I work with, or find challenges to help push my knowledge.
            I find hands on learning is the best way to become a strong developer.
